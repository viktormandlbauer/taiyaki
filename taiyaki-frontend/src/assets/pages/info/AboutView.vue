      <h2 class="h4 mb-3">❤️ Welcome to Taiyaki – A Bite of Japan in Every Smile</h2>
      <p>
        At Taiyaki, we believe every bite should tell a story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey began with a simple love for Japan’s most charming street snack –
        the taiyaki, a fish-shaped cake traditionally filled with red bean paste.
        We fell in love with its crispy edges, soft center, and the joy it brings
        to everyone who tries it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we’re sharing that joy with you – freshly baked and shipped straight to your home!

      <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Our Flavours, Your Favorites</h2>
      <p>
        From the classic red bean to matcha cream, custard, chocolate, and even seasonal specialties,
        each taiyaki is crafted with care, using high-quality ingredients and a touch of nostalgia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re reliving a trip to Japan or discovering taiyaki for the first time,
        we’ve got a flavour that’ll make you smile.

      <p>
        Our mission is to bring a little bit of Japanese happiness to your everyday moments –
        one taiyaki at a time. We’re passionate about tradition, creativity, and spreading joy
        through food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because life’s too short for boring desserts.
